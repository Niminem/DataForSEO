Nim client for the DataForSEO API (v3). No dependencies (stdlib only), supports both sync and async requests.

NOTE: This client is intentially low-level and you must refer to the (well-designed) [API documentation](https://docs.dataforseo.com/v3/?bash) for proper usage- no hand holding, minimal abstractions. We are using DataForSEO as part of our tooling ecosytem for my [SEO agency, SEO Science](https://www.seo.science). We unfortunately do not have the time to make a high-level API and keep up with all changes DFSEO may make.
